# Static Comp
This individual static comp challenge was designed to develop our HTML/CSS muscles during the second term of the Turing program. The challenge took me about 3 hours. The objective was to create a static site that reflects the designerâ€™s choice (image below) in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail.
